# Conversation Deduplication Changes

## Overview

Modified the conversation API endpoints to return only the latest/most recent conversation record when there are multiple records for the same conversation ID. This ensures that users always get the most up-to-date information for each conversation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Service Updates (`backend/services/database_service.py`)

#### Modified Methods:

**`get_conversations_by_account(account_id: str)`**
- **Before**: Returned all conversation records for an account, potentially including multiple records for the same conversation_id
- **After**: Uses PostgreSQL window function `ROW_NUMBER()` to return only the latest record per conversation_id
- **SQL Change**: Added `WITH ranked_conversations AS (...)` CTE with `PARTITION BY conversation_id ORDER BY created_at DESC`

**`get_conversations_by_date(target_date: datetime)`**
- **Before**: Returned all conversation records for a date, potentially including multiple records for the same conversation_id
- **After**: Uses the same window function approach to return only the latest record per conversation_id
- **SQL Change**: Added `WITH ranked_conversations AS (...)` CTE with `PARTITION BY conversation_id ORDER BY created_at DESC`

#### Added Method:

**`get_conversation_by_id(conversation_id: str)`**
- **Purpose**: Retrieve the latest conversation record for a specific conversation_id
- **Implementation**: Uses window function to ensure only the most recent record is returned
- **Returns**: Single conversation record or None if not found

### 2. SQL Query Changes

All conversation retrieval queries now use this pattern:

```sql
WITH ranked_conversations AS (
    SELECT 
        id, account_id, email_id, conversation_id, created_at,
        transcript_url, audio_url, report_url,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY conversation_id 
            ORDER BY created_at DESC
        ) as rn
    FROM conversation_runs 
    WHERE [additional_conditions]
)
SELECT id, account_id, email_id, conversation_id, created_at,
       transcript_url, audio_url, report_url
FROM ranked_conversations 
WHERE rn = 1
ORDER BY [sort_conditions]
```

### 3. API Endpoints Affected

The following API endpoints now return deduplicated results:

1. **`GET /api/v1/conversations/{account_id}`**
   - Returns only the latest conversation record per conversation_id for the specified account

2. **`GET /api/v1/conversations-by-date`**
   - Returns only the latest conversation record per conversation_id for the specified date

3. **`POST /api/v1/trigger-conversation-email`**
   - Uses the new `get_conversation_by_id` method to retrieve the latest conversation record

## Benefits

1. **Data Consistency**: Users always see the most recent version of each conversation
2. **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminates confusion from seeing multiple records for the same conversation
3. **Performance**: Reduces data transfer and processing overhead
4. **User Experience**: Cleaner, more intuitive API responses

## Testing

A test script `test_latest_conversations.py` has been created to verify:
- No duplicate conversation_ids are returned
- Latest records are correctly identified
- All endpoints work as expected

## Database Impact

- **No Schema Changes**: Existing database structure remains unchanged
- **Backward Compatible**: All existing data is preserved
- **Performance**: Window functions are efficient for this use case
- **Indexes**: Existing indexes on `conversation_id` and `created_at` support the new queries

## Migration Notes

- **No Migration Required**: Changes are query-level only
- **Immediate Effect**: Changes take effect immediately upon deployment
- **No Data Loss**: All historical data remains accessible
- **Rollback**: Can be easily reverted by changing the SQL queries back

## Example Response Changes

**Before (with duplicates):**
```json
{
  "conversations": [
    {"conversation_id": "conv_123", "created_at": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z"},
    {"conversation_id": "conv_123", "created_at": "2024-01-01T11:00:00Z"},
    {"conversation_id": "conv_456", "created_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"}
  ]
}
```

**After (deduplicated):**
```json
{
  "conversations": [
    {"conversation_id": "conv_123", "created_at": "2024-01-01T11:00:00Z"},
    {"conversation_id": "conv_456", "created_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"}
  ]
}
```

## Future Considerations

1. **Audit Trail**: Consider adding a separate audit table if historical processing records need to be preserved
2. **Soft Deletes**: Consider implementing soft deletes for conversation records
3. **Versioning**: Consider adding explicit version numbers to conversation records
4. **Cleanup**: Consider adding a cleanup job to remove old duplicate records
