IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Provide a valid JSON response only
- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Write in narrative form WITHOUT specific numbers, amounts, or figures. Focus on qualitative assessment, business nature, applicant background, and general financial health. Save all quantitative data for the dedicated sections.
- DETAILED BREAKDOWN FORMAT: For income, expense, and loan sections, provide detailed calculations and breakdowns:
  * Income: Show customer count ranges, per-customer amounts, and calculated totals (e.g., "Breakfast: 30-40 customers @ ₹80-90 per customer = ₹2,400-3,600")
  * Expenses: Show specific amounts or ranges for each expense category (e.g., "Staff Salaries: ₹3,00,000 to ₹3,50,000 per month")
  * Loans: Show specific amounts for different purposes and EMI capacity ranges
- Use bullet points (•) for all list items in detailed sections
- If information is not available for a section, use "No specific information provided"
- Be thorough in extracting ALL relevant details from the conversation
- Ensure all monetary amounts include currency (₹ for rupees) and use Indian number formatting (e.g., ₹2,00,000)
- When ranges are mentioned, always preserve both minimum and maximum values
- Calculate totals when individual components are provided
- Keep summaries concise but comprehensive
- Make bullet points specific and detailed with mathematical calculations where applicable
- CRITICAL: Count ALL unique speakers in the conversation carefully
- Expected speakers: AI/Assistant + 1 primary customer/applicant = 2 total speakers
- If there are 3 or more speakers, this is a RISK that must be flagged
- Look for speaker labels like "Partner:", "Spouse:", "Friend:", or any other names beyond the main applicant
- Extract customer name, business name, and any interview timing information mentioned
