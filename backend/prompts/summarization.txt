CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Provide a valid JSON response only
- NEVER INVENT OR MAKE UP INFORMATION
- If information is not available for a section, use "No specific information provided" or "Information not available"
- Only include details that were explicitly mentioned in the conversation
- Do not generate placeholder amounts, assumed values, or fictional data
- Be honest about the limitations of the conversation
- If the conversation was brief or incomplete, clearly state this
- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Write in narrative form WITHOUT specific numbers, amounts, or figures. Focus on what was actually discussed.
- DETAILED BREAKDOWN FORMAT: When information IS provided, use these specific formats:
  * Income: Show customer count ranges, per-customer amounts, and daily totals (e.g., "Breakfast: 30-40 customers @ ₹80-90 per customer = ₹2,400-3,600")
  * Expenses: Show specific amounts or ranges for each expense category (e.g., "Staff Salaries: ₹3,00,000 to ₹3,50,000 per month")
  * Loans: Show specific amounts for different purposes and EMI capacity ranges
  * Ownership: Indicate if business is owned or rented space.
- Use bullet points (•) for all list items in detailed sections
- If information is not available for a section, use "No specific information provided"
- Be thorough in extracting ALL relevant details from the conversation, but do not invent any
- Ensure all monetary amounts include currency (₹ for rupees) and use Indian number formatting (e.g., ₹2,00,000) - ONLY if these amounts were actually mentioned
- When ranges are mentioned, always preserve both minimum and maximum values
- Calculate daily totals for each income source (customer count × per-customer amount) - ONLY if both values were provided
- Calculate monthly total as: (sum of all daily income sources) × 30 days - ONLY if daily totals were calculated
- CRITICAL: Do NOT use any other calculation method. The monthly total MUST be calculated as daily total × 30 days.
- EXAMPLE: If daily income is ₹13,900-21,600, then monthly income = ₹13,900×30 to ₹21,600×30 = ₹4,17,000-6,48,000
- Keep summaries concise but comprehensive
- Make bullet points specific and detailed with accurate mathematical calculations - ONLY if the data was provided
- CRITICAL: Count ALL unique speakers in the conversation carefully
- Expected speakers: AI/Assistant + 1 primary customer/applicant = 2 total speakers
- If there are 3 or more speakers, this is a RISK that must be flagged
- Look for speaker labels like "Partner:", "Spouse:", "Friend:", or any other names beyond the main applicant
- Extract customer name, business name, and any interview timing information mentioned
- RECOMMENDATIONS: Only provide recommendations when sufficient information is available. If conversation is too brief or lacks financial details, clearly state that insufficient information is available for meaningful recommendations
- Add conversation_quality assessment to help determine if follow-up is needed
